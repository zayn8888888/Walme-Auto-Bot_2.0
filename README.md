git clone https://github.com/airdropinsiders/Walme-Auto-Bot.git
cd Walme-Auto-Bot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

3. Create configuration files:

Create a `tokens.txt` file in the root directory with one token per line:
```
yourToken1
yourToken2
```

For proxy support, create a `proxies.txt` file with one proxy per line:
```
http://username:password@host:port
socks5://username:password@host:port
host:port
username:password@host:port
host:port:username:password
```

## Usage

Start the bot with:
```bash
npm start
```

The bot will:
1. Load your tokens from tokens.txt
2. Load proxies from proxies.txt (if available)
3. Process each account, completing all available tasks
4. Check in for the 7-Day Challenge
5. Repeat the process every 24 hours

## Proxy Support

The bot supports various proxy formats:

- HTTP proxies: `http://user:pass@host:port` or `host:port`
- SOCKS4 proxies: `socks4://user:pass@host:port`
- SOCKS5 proxies: `socks5://user:pass@host:port`

The script will rotate through available proxies, assigning them to accounts in a round-robin fashion for optimal distribution.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Make sure your tokens are valid and properly formatted in tokens.txt
- Check that your proxies are working and properly formatted in proxies.txt
- Verify that you have installed all required dependencies
- Check the console for detailed error messages
